# PlatFORMR

The ubiquitous platformer genre, popularized by such classics as Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog, has matured into one of the most well-known categories in the realm of gaming. PlatFORMR offers a twist on the original idea, allowing users to create their own platforms and - by extension - forge their own journey.
